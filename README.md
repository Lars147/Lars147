Big AI enthusiast.

Trying to automate A LOT.

*Currently, I am experimenting with [openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) and make repos for AIs and Agents 🤖*

### Projects

| Repo | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| [knuspr-cli](https://github.com/Lars147/knuspr-cli) | 🛒 Knuspr.de grocery shopping from the terminal |
| [tmx-cli](https://github.com/Lars147/tmx-cli) | 🍳 Cookidoo/Thermomix meal planning & recipes CLI |
| [apo-cli](https://github.com/Lars147/apo-cli) | 💊 Pharmacy shopping from the terminal |


_If you need a cli for your Agent and the service offers MCP, just use [mcporter](https://github.com/steipete/mcporter)_
